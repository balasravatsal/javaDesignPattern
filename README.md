# Design Patterns Overview

This project contains implementations of several design patterns commonly used in software design. Each pattern serves a specific purpose and solves recurring design problems. Below is a brief description of each pattern:

### 1. **Abstract Factory Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows you to encapsulate a group of factories with a common theme.
   - **Use Case**: Creating different UI elements for different operating systems (Windows, macOS, etc.) using the same code.

### 2. **Adapter Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting one interface into another.
   - **Use Case**: When integrating a new class that doesn’t conform to the required interface.

### 3. **Builder Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Builder pattern allows for the step-by-step construction of complex objects. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing for the same construction process to create different representations.
   - **Use Case**: Building complex objects like multi-part documents, meals in a restaurant system, or objects with numerous configurations.

### 4. **Composite Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Composite pattern allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is used to represent part-whole hierarchies.
   - **Use Case**: Representing a file system where both files and directories are treated as elements in a hierarchy.

### 5. **Decorator Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Decorator pattern allows for the dynamic addition of behavior or responsibilities to an object without modifying its code. It uses composition instead of inheritance to extend functionality.
   - **Use Case**: Extending the functionality of graphical user interface components like adding scroll bars to a window, or dynamically adding features to a text editor.

### 6. **Facade Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the system and provides an easy-to-use interface.
   - **Use Case**: Simplifying client interaction with a complex system, like a library management system with multiple subsystems for book management, users, and transactions.

### 7. **Factory Method Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It provides a way to instantiate objects in a subclass without knowing their specific class.
   - **Use Case**: Managing the creation of objects when the exact type of the object is not known until runtime, like creating different types of documents in an application.

### 8. **Flyweight Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Flyweight pattern reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects. It allows sharing of objects to minimize memory usage.
   - **Use Case**: Optimizing memory usage in applications like a text editor where multiple characters or graphical elements are repeated.

### 9. **Iterator Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.
   - **Use Case**: Traversing collections like arrays, lists, or trees in a uniform way, for example, iterating through items in a shopping cart.

### 10. **Memento Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Memento pattern captures and externalizes an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later, without violating encapsulation.
   - **Use Case**: Implementing undo functionality in text editors or game state save and restore systems.

### 11. **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: MVC separates an application into three main components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic). This separation helps in decoupling the business logic from the UI, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.
   - **Use Case**: Web applications where the user interface, business logic, and database access are distinct components.

### 12. **Observer Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   - **Use Case**: Implementing event handling systems like in a messaging app where a user’s status is updated for all contacts.

### 13. **Prototype Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Prototype pattern is used to create objects by copying a pre-existing object (prototype) instead of creating a new instance from scratch. It is particularly useful when the object creation process is complex or resource-intensive.
   - **Use Case**: Cloning objects in applications where object creation is expensive, such as copying graphical elements in a drawing application.

### 14. **Singleton Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   - **Use Case**: Managing shared resources like database connections or logging in an application.

### 15. **State Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: The State pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class by switching its state.
   - **Use Case**: Handling the state of a document or user interface elements that can switch between different states (e.g., a media player switching between play, pause, and stop states).
